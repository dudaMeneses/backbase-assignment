To better split and organize what needs to be done I divided the functionalities into 3 epics: `Oscar Winners`, `Rating` and `Top Rated Movie Search`. This can be followed by this [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/CP3SrUvF/backbase-challenge). Also, an epic called `General` was created to accommodate topics useful for the whole application, such as `security`, `CI/CD` and things like that.
